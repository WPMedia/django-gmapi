======================
Django Google Maps API
======================

This app allows you to define Map and Marker objects in Python.

These objects are designed to be serialized to JSON and parsed by the included
jQuery plugin which converts them to actual Google Map and Marker instances.

They can also be converted to strings which produces a Static Maps url.

This way you can easily use unobtrusive javascript techniques along with maps.

This project is being developed as one piece of a larger project I'm working on.
So functionality will be added as I need it. In particular, the jQuery plugin
will probably see some added functionality.

Version 3 of the Google Geocoding Web service is also implemented to further
enable an unobtrusive javascript approach.
